            Here, you’ll find a collection of my favorite projects where I’ve
            brought design and code to life. From full-stack Shopify builds to
            React-powered applications, each project reflects my journey of
            adapting and innovating. Explore the stories behind each, including
            Turmerry.com – where I led a major redesign – and many more that
            highlight my technical skills and creative problem-solving.
